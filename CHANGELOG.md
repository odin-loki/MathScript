# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Wave-by-wave implementation history (thousands of entries) is in [`docs/WAVES.md`](docs/WAVES.md). Current architecture, API, and release criteria are in [`docs/`](docs/).

## [Unreleased]

CMake project version **1.0.0**. The git tag `v1.0.0` is not cut; it still follows the gates in [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md) (CI green, coverage ≥ 90%, Valgrind clean, fuzz-24h, packaging, benches, compliance, JIT). After local prove-out, packaging is next.

- Linux `-fno-exceptions`: control `c2d`/`d2c` helpers in `repl_engine_internal.cpp` no longer wrap non-throwing `control::*` calls in `try`/`catch`.
- Clang plugin builds on LLVM 18: `DeclNamespace.h` is included only when present (`NamespaceDecl` is already in `Decl.h`); narrowing diagnostics use `CK_*` instead of `ImplicitCastKind`; unused-`expected` is detected via discarded `CallExpr` (Clang has no `ExprStmt`).
- Plugin smoke test: Clang 18 requires capturing function-local constexpr string arrays in the unsafe-registry lambda.
- Clang plugin: ignore system headers; do not treat written casts as implicit narrowing; allow `(void)` discards; treat initialized/`auto` locals as initialized. Compliance `unused_expected` uses a local `expected` stand-in (libstdc++ `std::expected` is unavailable under Clang + `-fno-exceptions` on CI).
- Tests: unwrap `EXPECT_NO_THROW`/`ASSERT_NO_THROW` (GoogleTest always emits `try`/`catch` for those macros). `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` remains set for GCC/Clang tests.
- CLI tests: decode POSIX `std::system` wait status so `mathscriptc` exit 1 is not compared as 256.
- DiffGeo unit helix torsion: GCC -O3 third-derivative FD is ~0.03 off analytic 1/2; tolerance is 4e-2.
- Signal+optim pipeline: compare residual energy vs each tone (unit sines share RMS, so the old closeness check was noise).
- Linux Debug CI (coverage/ASan): `MS_LINK_TESTS_SHARED` builds `libms_bundle.so` so 816 test executables do not each copy the static library. Coverage instruments `src/` only. Valgrind still skips per-file integration binaries (memcheck time).
- `UNSAFE_REVIEW.md`: plugin diagnostics moved into rule TUs; crypto string_view overloads share one `u8_view`; `approved_sites` is 38.
- Linux package smoke: Debian CPack uses `mathscript_1.0.0_amd64.deb` (`DEB-DEFAULT`); CI glob is `mathscript*.deb`.
- `linux-gcc13.json` matmul medians recalibrated from GitHub-hosted ubuntu-24.04 (`MS_ENABLE_AVX512=OFF`). Tolerance remains 10%.
- Local prove-out (Windows MSVC Release, CUDA off): **816/816** CTest suites passed (~36 s at `-j 32`); 28 Google Benchmark targets passed with `--benchmark_min_time=0.001s`. Windows ZIP smoke: `scripts/package_smoke.ps1` → `mathscript-1.0.0-win64.zip`.
- MSVC `/W4` compile warnings in library and test TUs were cleared (unused locals, `[[nodiscard]]`, `size_t`→`int`, unused statics).
- Tests are grouped by mathematical domain (`tests/unit/linalg`, `tests/integration/fft`, …). Duplicate remigration wave pipelines were collapsed.
- REPL matrix calls use a name-keyed handler registry (`src/interp/matrix_calls/<domain>/`); CMake generates `matrix_call_register_all.cpp`.
- 28 Google Benchmark targets in the same tree as the library (`MS_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON`).
- Local Windows build directory: `build-msvc` only.
