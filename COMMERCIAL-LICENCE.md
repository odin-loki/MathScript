# Commercial licence — MathScript

MathScript is dual licensed.

## 1. Free tier — AGPL-3.0 or later

You may use, modify and distribute MathScript under the terms of the **GNU Affero General
Public License, version 3 or later** (see `LICENSE`) at no cost if you are:

- an individual, using it personally;
- a registered charity or not-for-profit;
- an educational institution, or a student or researcher at one;
- an organisation with **annual income under AUD 50,000**.

Obligations under this tier:

- **Share modifications back** under the same dual licence.
- **Open-source research** built on the software.
- **Carry the attribution line** in your about box, documentation or footer:

  > Powered by MathScript, developed by Odin Loch. Licensed under AGPL-3.0+.

- The AGPL's network clause applies: if users interact with a modified version over a
  network, they are entitled to its corresponding source. If you are running this as a
  hosted service, read that clause carefully — it is usually the reason organisations
  take the commercial licence instead.

## 2. Commercial licence

Organisations with annual income of **AUD 50,000 or more**, and any organisation that
needs to keep its modifications private, require a commercial licence.

A commercial licence removes:

- the obligation to publish your modifications;
- the copyleft reach into your own codebase;
- the AGPL network-distribution clause;
- the attribution requirement (you may still include it if you wish).

Pricing is tiered by organisation size and quoted per enquiry. Per-project and
catalogue-wide licences are both available.

## 3. What this licence does not cover

`vendor/` contains third-party code that is **not** Imortek's to license and is **not**
covered by either tier above. It remains under its own upstream terms:

| Path | Component | Upstream licence |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/googletest/` | GoogleTest 1.14.0 | BSD-3-Clause |

See `vendor/googletest/LICENSE` for the full text and `vendor/VERSIONS.txt` for the
pinned upstream commit. Everything outside `vendor/` — `src/`, `include/`, `exe/`,
`tests/`, `cmake/`, `scripts/`, `docs/` — is Imortek work and is covered by the terms
above.

## 4. Previous licence

MathScript previously carried **no licence file at all**, which meant default copyright applied — no permission to use, copy, modify or distribute was granted to anyone. Adding AGPL-3.0+ grants those rights for the first time; it does not take any away.

## 5. No warranty, and this is not legal advice

The software is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. This document is a plain-language summary written by the author, not by a
lawyer. The AGPL-3.0 text in `LICENSE` and any executed commercial agreement are what
actually bind.
